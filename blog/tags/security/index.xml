&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while back, I &lt;a href="http://raidersec.blogspot.com/2013/01/wireless-deauth-attack-using-aireplay.html"&gt;published a post&lt;/a&gt; on the Raidersec blog demonstrating how to perform a deauthentication attack using Python and Scapy. I enjoyed writing the post, since I got the opportunity to learn in-depth about how different wireless attacks work, beyond just learning how to exclusively use the &lt;a href="http://www.aircrack-ng.org/"&gt;aircrack suite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with that being said, this post will kick off a short series of posts discussing how to perform common wireless attacks using Python. I hope you enjoy the posts and, as always, never hesitate to let me know if you have any comments or questions below.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to Pentest iPhone Apps with Burp</title><link>https://jordan-wright.com/blog/2013/11/07/how-to-pentest-iphone-apps-with-burp/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2013 21:50:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jordan-wright.com/blog/2013/11/07/how-to-pentest-iphone-apps-with-burp/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://jordan-wright.com/blog/images/headers/iphone_burp.png" alt="" class="pure-img" &gt;

&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking at the functionality of mobile apps, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that they aren&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; different than web applications. They often just serve as a frontend for the data stored on a central backend server or database. As such, if developers aren&amp;rsquo;t careful to protect these apps, many of the &lt;a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013"&gt;same vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt; we find in standard web applications (such as injection attacks on unvalidated input) can be exploited by attackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post will show how to setup the iPhone to work with the popular &lt;a href="http://portswigger.net/burp/download.html"&gt;Burp Suite&lt;/a&gt; so that traffic from apps can be intercepted and tested for vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
