&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every morning, the infosec field is greeted with an onslaught of freshly registered malicious domains. These domains are used to host phishing sites, maintain botnet command and control, harvest stolen information, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having the complete list of registered domains day-by-day offers substantial visibility that can be used for intel and repsonse. Fortunately, such lists not only exist, but are available (usually for free!) with little effort involved. This post will introduce TLD zone files, how to access them, and how they can be used to your benefit.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
