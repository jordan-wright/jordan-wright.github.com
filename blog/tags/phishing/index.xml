&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sites like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phishtank.com/phish_archive.php&#34;&gt;phishtank&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.clean-mx.com/clean-mx/phishing.php&#34;&gt;clean-mx&lt;/a&gt; act as crowdsourced phishing detection and validation. By knowing how to look, you can consistently find &lt;a href=&#34;http://jordan-wright.github.io/blog/2014/04/04/a-look-at-comment-spam-generator-scripts/&#34;&gt;interesting information&lt;/a&gt; about how attackers work, and the tools they use to conduct phishing campaigns. This post will give an example of how &lt;em&gt;phishing kits&lt;/em&gt; are used, how to find them, as well as show a case study into other tools attackers use to maintain access to compromised servers.

      <description>Introduction It&amp;rsquo;s been a while! I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy getting gophish closer and closer to beta. Should be ready soon!
Until then, here&amp;rsquo;s a quick look at some comment spam scripts I discovered when perusing through the content over at phishtank.com.
As a side note, the scripts were bundled as some Louis Vuitton spam, though that doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to relate to the content of the spam scripts at all.
The Spam Scripts Here are the scripts - the format looks very similar to those found by Alex King.</description>
