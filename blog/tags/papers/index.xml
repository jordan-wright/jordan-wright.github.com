&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a proponent and contributor of open-source projects and information. I strongly believe that information and knowledge should be shared as much and as freely as possible - progress happens this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to &amp;ldquo;open-source&amp;rdquo;, if you will, the academic essays I wrote regarding information security and software development my last couple of semesters at Texas Tech. It&amp;rsquo;s my hope that people find these useful, either by provoking thought and discussion or simply by serving as material to help people fall asleep a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please bear in mind some of these papers were written &lt;del&gt;the night before&lt;/del&gt; in a short time-span.
