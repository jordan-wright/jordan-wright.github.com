      <description>Introduction It&amp;rsquo;s been a while! I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy getting gophish closer and closer to beta. Should be ready soon!
Until then, here&amp;rsquo;s a quick look at some comment spam scripts I discovered when perusing through the content over at phishtank.com.
As a side note, the scripts were bundled as some Louis Vuitton spam, though that doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to relate to the content of the spam scripts at all.
