&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the third post in my series on how Tor works! In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jordan-wright.com/blog/blog/categories/tor/&#34;&gt;past two posts&lt;/a&gt;, we talked about how clients tunnel traffic through relays, as well as introduced the idea of unpublished relays called bridges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how do clients know what relays are active? How is the Tor network actually organized and maintained? This post will answer this question by talking about a living document called the &lt;strong&gt;consensus&lt;/strong&gt; as well as introducing a few very important Tor nodes that run the show behind the scenes.
