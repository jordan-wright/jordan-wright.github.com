&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while back, I &lt;a href="http://raidersec.blogspot.com/2013/01/wireless-deauth-attack-using-aireplay.html"&gt;published a post&lt;/a&gt; on the Raidersec blog demonstrating how to perform a deauthentication attack using Python and Scapy. I enjoyed writing the post, since I got the opportunity to learn in-depth about how different wireless attacks work, beyond just learning how to exclusively use the &lt;a href="http://www.aircrack-ng.org/"&gt;aircrack suite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with that being said, this post will kick off a short series of posts discussing how to perform common wireless attacks using Python. I hope you enjoy the posts and, as always, never hesitate to let me know if you have any comments or questions below.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
