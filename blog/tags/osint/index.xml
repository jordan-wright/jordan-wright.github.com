&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When performing a social engineering engagement, recon is key. In a &lt;a href=&#34;http://raidersec.blogspot.com/2012/12/automated-open-source-intelligence.html&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I demonstrated a few ways in which we could automate the recon process. However, the methods I showed were simply ways to find the profiles of people that might belong to a particular organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During SE engagements, we often either run across email addresses (by, say, simply scraping the main website) or want to enumerate the email address structure in use by an organization (generating possible alternatives using tools like jigsaw.rb). It would be helpful if it were possible to automate the process of validating those email addresses by associating them to additional information or social networking profiles. This is where Rapportive comes in handy.&lt;/p&gt;
