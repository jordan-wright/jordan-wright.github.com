&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while back, I came across the article from the The Washington Post describing We Heart It, a social network claiming &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/05/07/30-million-people-use-this-social-network-and-youve-probably-never-heard-of-it/&#34;&gt;over 30 million users&lt;/a&gt;. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it, &lt;a href=&#34;http://weheartit.com&#34;&gt;We Heart It&lt;/a&gt; (from here on out abbreviated as WHI) is a social network which encourages people to post and share photos and images of things that inspire them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having such a large user-base, I was interested in seeing what kind of API the site offered developers. However, I was disappointed when I found out that the API was &lt;a href=&#34;https://weheartit.com/partners&#34;&gt;closed to &amp;ldquo;partners&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, and even this is not a full REST API, but rather a simple button developers can place on their website to allow users to interact with WHI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this being the case, I decided to take a look at the Android and iPhone apps using both static and dynamic analysis in an experiment to see if I could reverse engineer the API used on the backend. Here are the results.
