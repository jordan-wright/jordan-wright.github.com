&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s been a while! While I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted as much here, I have been writing quite a bit &lt;a href=&#34;https://duo.com/blog/post_author/jwright&#34;&gt;over on Duo&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a&gt; about the really cool research I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten to do this past year with the incredible Duo Labs team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any spare time I&amp;rsquo;ve had has been spent working on Gophish. This past year I&amp;rsquo;ve released a &lt;a href=&#34;https://getgophish.com&#34;&gt;new hand-crafted, artisinal website&lt;/a&gt;, responded to nearly 400 support requests, and made too many improvements to count!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, most people who use Gophish use a pre-built binary&lt;a href=&#34;#footnote-1&#34;&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;, which means that it&amp;rsquo;s important to make new releases as soon as possible after improvements are made. Otherwise, I&amp;rsquo;m left answering support requests with the advice of &amp;ldquo;build from source&amp;rdquo;, which is not ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous release process was manual, making it a &lt;strong&gt;huge pain&lt;/strong&gt;. This led to inconsistency and large amounts of time spent packaging every release, which results in very infrequent releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post documents the previous process as well as how I recently improved it using Ansible, Docker, DigitalOcean API&amp;rsquo;s, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
