&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the process of planning a vacation, I came across a nice hotel I wanted to stay at. When looking at some possible dates, I noticed the nightly rate would fluctuate &lt;em&gt;dramatically&lt;/em&gt;. This made me question if I was going to wind up paying way more just because I wanted to stay at the hotel on a certain day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I considered the alternative - maybe I could scrape the prices every day to find the cheapest nightly rate. Sounded like a job for Python, BeautifulSoup, and some whiskey.
