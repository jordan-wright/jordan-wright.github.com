&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every morning, the infosec field is greeted with an onslaught of freshly registered malicious domains. These domains are used to host phishing sites, maintain botnet command and control, harvest stolen information, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having the complete list of registered domains day-by-day offers substantial visibility that can be used for intel and repsonse. Fortunately, such lists not only exist, but are available (usually for free!) with little effort involved. This post will introduce TLD zone files, how to access them, and how they can be used to your benefit.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Decompiling Android Apps the Easy Way</title><link>https://jordan-wright.com/blog/2014/08/10/decompiling-android-apps-the-easy-way/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jordan-wright.com/blog/2014/08/10/decompiling-android-apps-the-easy-way/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://jordan-wright.com/blog/images/headers/android_apps.png" alt="" class="pure-img" &gt;

&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile applications are often viewed as black-box applications. However, these applications often suffer from the same (or similar) vulnerabilities as their web application counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://jordan-wright.github.io/blog/2013/11/07/how-to-pentest-iphone-apps-with-burp/"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I showed how we can perform dynamic analysis on iPhone applications by intercepting the inbound/outbound traffic with the Burp proxy. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore static analysis of Android apps by looing at a couple of online tools that make decompiling apps into equivalent Java and Smali code trivial.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
