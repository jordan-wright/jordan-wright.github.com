However, I was disappointed when I found out that the API was <a href=https://weheartit.com/partners>closed to &ldquo;partners&rdquo;</a>, and even this is not a full REST API, but rather a simple button developers can place on their website to allow users to interact with WHI.</p><p>With this being the case, I decided to take a look at the Android and iPhone apps using both static and dynamic analysis in an experiment to see if I could reverse engineer the API used on the backend.

After getting used to the syntax and remembering what a pointer is for (thanks, Python), Go has become a favorite language to develop with. I&rsquo;m even using it for the <a href=http://www.matasano.com/articles/crypto-challenges/>Matasano Crypto Challenges</a> (which are <em>awesome</em>).</p><p>While the standard library in Go is definitely robust, being a young language, there are a few niceties that aren&rsquo;t yet included. Sending email is one of them. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Go has a wonderful <a href=http://golang.org/pkg/net/smtp/>SMTP</a> package, <a href=http://golang.org/pkg/mime/>MIME</a> package, and even a <a href=http://golang.org/pkg/net/mail/>Mail</a> package (which <em>only</em> parses existing email messages). However, there is no library to actually <strong>create</strong> emails in a meaningful way. Since <a href=https://github.com/jordan-wright/gophish>Gophish</a> relies heavily on sending emails, I&rsquo;ve sought to change this. And, after reading more RFC&rsquo;s than I normally prefer, I believe I&rsquo;ve created a package that provides intuitive, robust, and flexible email creation and sending called <a href=https://github.com/jordan-wright/email>email</a>.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s see how to use it.</p><a class="read-more icon-standard" href=/blog/2014/01/03/building-gophish-how-to-send-email-with-go/>Read More</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><img class=author-thumb src=https://jordan-wright.com/blog/images/jordan-profile.jpg alt="Author image" nopin=nopin>

In recent years, we&rsquo;ve seen a rise in spear-phishing attacks targeting large organizations, most of which are largely successful. The goal of this toolkit will be to provide businesses and penetration testers with the ability to quickly and easily perform in-house or contracted phishing engagements, and track the responses to see where improvements can be made. This toolkit will be called <a href=https://github.com/jordan-wright/gophish>gophish</a>.</p><p>In addition to this, I&rsquo;ve been casually poking around at <a href=http://golang.org/><code>go</code></a> for a while now, and have decided it would be good to finally put it to use in a larger project. I&rsquo;m a fan of seeing the steady development and updates of projects as they are created. I believe it can help keep the developer motivated and the users informed and involved, so this is what I&rsquo;m going to do. Hopefully, these posts will allow others to learn alongside me, as well as spur improvements from experienced <code>go</code> developers so that <a href=https://github.com/jordan-wright/gophish>gophish</a> can be the best product possible.</p><p>With that being said - let&rsquo;s get started!</p><a class="read-more icon-standard" href=/blog/2013/11/29/building-gophish-day-1/>Read More</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><img class=author-thumb src=https://jordan-wright.com/blog/images/jordan-profile.jpg alt="Author image" nopin=nopin>

I will be continuing my work with Linkedin&rsquo;s security team to iron out any bugs we can find.

The premise is simple: allow iPhone users to see details about the people they are emailing within the native iPhone Mail App. Think <a href=http://rapportive.com/>Rapportive</a> for the iPhone Mail App, because that&rsquo;s <em>essentially</em> what this is (and made by the same people).</p><p>However, when reading the initial description of Intro, there was one part that caught my eye:</p><blockquote><p>David says Crosswise would love to work with you. Is this spam, or the real deal?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>With Intro, you can immediately see what David looks like, where he’s based, and what he does. You can see that he’s the CEO of Crosswise. This is the real deal.</p></blockquote><p>This is not much different than Linkedin saying &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve put a picture of a lock in your email, so you know for sure it&rsquo;s secure&rdquo;. Linkedin is simply giving its users a false sense of security. In this post, we&rsquo;ll take a look and see what <em>exactly</em> Linkedin is doing to its users&rsquo; email, as well as how we can spoof this information, gaining full control of the information shown to the user.</p><a class="read-more icon-standard" href=/blog/2013/10/26/phishing-with-linkedins-intro/>Read More</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><img class=author-thumb src=https://jordan-wright.com/blog/images/jordan-profile.jpg alt="Author image" nopin=nopin>
