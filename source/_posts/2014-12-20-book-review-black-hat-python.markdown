### Introduction
I was excited to read [Black Hat Python: Python Programming for Hackers and Pentesters](http://www.amazon.com/Black-Hat-Python-Programming-Pentesters/dp/1593275900/) by Justin Seitz.

### Chapters 1 Through 5: Basics and Web App Hacking
This book starts slow. A good amount of readable networking basics.
Scapy is used - that's nice.
No ```requests```? No ```beautifulsoup```?

### Chapter 6: Extending Burp Proxy

### Chapter 7: GitHub Command and Control
I have written about reusing existing tools in the past (raidersec link)

### Chapters 8 Through 10: Windows API Automation

### Chapter 11: Automating Offensive Forensics
I was happy to see strong mention and use of the Volatity framework.
