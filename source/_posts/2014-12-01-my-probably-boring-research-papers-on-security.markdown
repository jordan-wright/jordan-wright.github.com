### Introduction
I've always been a proponent and contributor of open-source projects and information. I strongly believe that information and knowledge should be shared as much and as freely as possible - progress happens this way.

As such, I've decided to "open-source", if you will, the academic essays I wrote regarding information security and software development my last couple of semesters at Texas Tech. It's my hope that people find these useful, either by provoking thought and discussion or simply by serving as material to help people fall asleep a little easier.

Please bear in mind some of these papers were written ~~the night before~~ in a short time-span.

* [*Paradigm Shift in Software Development*](https://www.dropbox.com/s/db2tbau0jdv9pym/Paradigm%20Exercise.pdf?dl=0) - A brief look into how the creation and establishment of the OSS movement created a paradigm shift in software development methodologies.

As always, let me know if you have any questions or comments below! It is worth noting that I do my best to provide the best attribution possible, but if you find mistakes please let me know and I will correct it immediately.

Enjoy!
