Hi there! My name is Jordan, and I am a security researcher, developer, and hobbyist. 

For the past few years, I created and maintained a blog for an organization I started called [Raidersec](http://raidersec.blogspot.com). While I fully intend to leave the existing content on the Raidersec blog, I thought it would be ideal to create a personal blog on which I can continue writing about my research and projects dealing with not just security, but programming in general.

I have quite a few projects in the works that I am excited to share soon! For now, feel free to check out my [existing projects](/projects), and [let me know](/contact) if you have any questions or comments!
